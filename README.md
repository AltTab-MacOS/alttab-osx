## What is AltTab?  

**AltTab for Mac** is a utility that brings a more familiar and powerful window-switching experience to macOS. While macOS provides a built-in app switcher with Command + Tab, it lacks flexibility and detailed previews. AltTab solves this by offering a Windows-style approach, giving users clearer control over their workspace.  

With **AltTab macOS**, users can toggle not only between applications but also individual windows. The tool displays real-time previews in a customizable grid or list, allowing for quick identification of the window you want. For those who prefer to fine-tune their experience, AltTab offers options to adjust shortcuts, themes, transparency, and animation speed.  

Key features include:  
- Switching between apps and windows using **Alt + Tab** just like on Windows.  
- Thumbnail previews of open documents, browsers, and tools.  
- Custom keyboard shortcuts for advanced workflows.  
- Multi-desktop and full-screen app support.  
- Integration with both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.  

The program is designed to feel lightweight yet powerful, running smoothly on **MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini**. It is optimized for modern versions of macOS including **Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma**.  

Whether you’re a developer juggling multiple code windows, a designer working across creative apps, or simply someone who prefers the familiar Windows-style interface, **AltTab for Mac** provides an efficient, user-friendly solution for multitasking.
